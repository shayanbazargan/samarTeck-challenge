# 🛍️ Nuxt 3  Mini E-Commerce (Frontend Challenge project)

> 🧱 This is a responsive frontend-only e-commerce challenge project built using **Nuxt 3**, **Vue 3**, **Vuetify 3**.

> 🎯 The goal was to demonstrate a real product listing UI, clean architecture, and responsive layout logic using modern Vue ecosystem tools.

> 💡 The application fetches data from [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com) and implements local filtering and sorting to simulate real-world e-commerce behavior — without backend interaction.
> 🧪 fetched data manipulated on the client (due to limitations of the FakeStore API).
